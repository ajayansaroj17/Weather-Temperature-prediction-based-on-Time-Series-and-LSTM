## Summary:
The weather forecast frequently differs from reality due to climate change. In the interim, weather forecasts are essential for daily life, notably in the global agricultural sectors of industrialised nations. We can assess a city's overall weather conditions with the use of information technology tools and apply more advanced, contemporary scientific procedures for a more accurate analysis and forecast of the weather based on data obtained for a week or more in advance.
